## State of worry
Albert Einstein once remarked, "Creativity is seeing what others see and thinking what no one else ever thought”. But one can argue that he has not gone through a long-drawn pandemic, where most of us have worked longer hours and taken new decisions from mundane activities to complex business problems. In the last two and half years, we have gone from being locked down in our homes to long queues of vaccines, and then back to locking down again for new variants. Eat, sleep, vaccine, repeat...! We are constantly being bombarded with negative news and events daily. This constant state of worry and uncertainty has become a new normal. This new normal has taken a toll on our collective mindset and depleted our infinite reserves of creativity. It was in mid-October when I looked at my [blog archives](https://www.gaurgaurav.com/archives/){:target="_blank"} and realized my mental resources are EMPTY, with nothing left at all. I have gone bankrupt on my creative thoughts. It was at this moment I realized that I should replenish my creative reservoirs. This article deliberates upon five steps that I have taken to regain my creativity since then.

## Step 1. Take a break
In our industry, _‘downtime’_ is sometimes perceived as dirty, while being busy feels like an honour. But the brain, like any other muscle in our body, can suffer exhaustion if overworked. We all know that [all work and no play makes Tom a dull boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_work_and_no_play_makes_Jack_a_dull_boy){:taget="_blank"}. I spread my breaks throughout the year. Every season, around the year, is associated with a different shade of nature, and it is fun to experience those. Recently, I visited a village in the Cotswolds. A village built with golden-coloured stone offering a picturesque riverside walk. Even though the trip was small, it had an immense impact on my mood.
