## Introduction
Many organizations are migrating to the cloud to leverage on-demand infrastructure and scale their applications. However, such migrations are never straightforward. We need established patterns and control points to manage the complexity. I have discussed a few of the known patterns in my previous blog posts. In this article, I will cover another scalability pattern called the Orchestrator Pattern. This design allows the building of scalable, reliant, and fault-tolerant systems. The pattern can manage the flow and coordination among components of a distributed system but is primarily used in a microservices architecture. Let us examine at a problem statement to understand it better.
