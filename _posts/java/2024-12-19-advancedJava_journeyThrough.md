## Advanced Java Features: An Overview
In software development, professionals are always learning. Programming languages change, and at the same time, this creates new ways to write better, cleaner, and more effective code. Java is a language that has lasted over time and still keeps amazing us with its depth and flexibility. Until recently, I had decided to upgrade myself with the advanced features of Java and was excited to share this journey with you in this series of blog posts.

Whether one is an experienced Java developer or a newcomer venturing into its complex functionalities, this series is purposed to render advanced concepts both accessible and applicable. These features are not just theoretical constructs but instruments for crafting more maintainable, resilient, and contemporary Java applications. Consider this series as a thoughtfully organized pathway aimed at enhancing proficiency in Java.


## Why Now?

With the release of Java 21, a number of improvements and new features are in store for review. Oracle's commitment to regular releases-a new minor version every six months, with major long-term support releases every few years-means that Java is always up-to-date and relevant. While I will be working with Java 21, but the concepts I discuss will remain relevant to newer versions as well.

The following is an overview of what is coming in this series:

* **Records:** Elegant encoding of data carrier classes.
* **Sealed Classes and Interfaces:** Precise control of class hierarchies.
* **Pattern Matching:** The writing of clear and eloquent code.
* **Advanced Class and Interface Features:** Some less-well-known but powerful features.
* **Deep Dive on Generics:** How to clarify one of the most complex yet central Java features.
* **Lambda Expressions:** Using functional programming principles within Java.
* **Annotations:** Using metadata to annotate your code massively.
* **Optional Type:** Writing null-free code that's safer and more intentional, too.
* **Try-with-Resources Statement:** Gracefully managing resources with style and elegance.

I will try to explain each of these topics in separate articles, with examples, explanations, and context. I want to share not just how to use them but why these features work like they do.


## Let us Learn Together
Learning advanced Java features may be a little intimidating, but remember: every expert was once a beginner. In this series of blog posts, I hope to create a shared space for learning where we can explore, experiment, and grow together as Java enthusiasts.

So get your favourite IDE and let's dive deep into the Java world. I will publish my first post soon.
