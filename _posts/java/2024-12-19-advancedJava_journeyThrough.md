## Overview
In software development, professionals are always learning. Programming languages change, and at the same time, this creates new ways to write better, cleaner, and more effective code. Java is a language that has lasted over time and still keeps amazing us with its depth and flexibility. Until recently, I had decided to upgrade myself with the advanced features of Java and was excited to share this journey with you in this series of blog posts.

Whether you are an experienced Java developer or a newcomer trying to explore these functionalities, the series aims to present the concepts in an easy-to-understand and practically applicable fashion. These features are not just theoretical constructs but instruments for developing more resilient, proficient and maintainable Java applications.


## Why Now?

With the release of Java 21, a number of improvements and new features are in store for review. Oracle's commitment to regularly release a new minor version every six months and major long-term support releases every few years means that Java is always up-to-date and relevant. While I will be practising with Java 21, the concepts I discuss will definitely be relevant to any version of Java.


## What to Expect?
The following is an overview of what is coming in this series:

* **Records:** Elegant encoding of data carrier classes.
* **Sealed Classes and Interfaces:** Precise control of class hierarchies.
* **Pattern Matching:** The writing of clear and eloquent code.
* **Advanced Class and Interface Features:** Some less-well-known but powerful features.
* **Deep Dive on Generics:** How to clarify one of the most complex yet central Java features.
* **Lambda Expressions:** Using functional programming principles within Java.
* **Annotations:** Using metadata to annotate your code massively.
* **Optional Type:** Writing null-free code that's safer and more intentional, too.
* **Try-with-Resources Statement:** Gracefully managing resources with style and elegance.

I will try to explain each of these topics in separate articles, with examples, explanations, and context. I want to share not just how to use them but why these features work like they do.


## Let us Learn Together
Learning advanced Java features may feel like a draining journey. In this series of blog posts, I hope to create a shared space for learning where we can explore, experiment, and grow together as Java enthusiasts.

So get your favourite IDE and let's dive deep into the Java world. I will publish my first post soon.
