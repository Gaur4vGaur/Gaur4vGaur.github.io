## Limitless Creativity
Last November, I got to spend more time with my 8-year-old nephew. Since we last met, he had added a one more box of Legos, lots of pencils, acrylic paints, and crayons to his collection. Soon, he began showing off his home creations and schoolbook contribution with that excitement only a child can feel.

Every Lego structure, every drawing, and every little craft project came with its own enthusiastic explanation. Instructions? Who needs them! He followed his instincts, building and creating in ways that felt right to him, unconstrained by rules or expectations.

I was struck by how these simple toys and tools became, in his hands, gateways to limitless creativity. Watching him reminded me of the pure joy and freedom that come with creating something entirely your own.
