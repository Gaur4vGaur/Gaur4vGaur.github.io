Sometimes in our careers, we feel like we're not progressing from our current level; well, who doesn't? The least said about it, it is an annoying place to be: working hard, putting in long hours, and feeling like our career is going nowhere. I was there too. So, after having navigated my way through it, here's advice I wish I could give my past self.


## The Reality Check: Why Hard Work Alone Isn’t Enough 
I’ve noticed a common myth at workplaces that working long hours will get you a promotion. The reality is that putting in extra hours is not a differentiator. While dedication and a strong work ethic are important, it may not take you to the next level. Any leadership looks for people who can tackle higher level challenges and lead through influence rather than effort. You have more chances to move forward if you are a strategic thinker rather than a hard worker.

A lot of successful experts who have climbed the ladder have a few things in common: they prioritize strategic impact, lead by example, and take the initiative to tackle further complex challenges. Camille Fournier, former CTO of Rent the Runway, emphasizes in her book The Manager's Path that transitioning from an individual contributor to a leadership role requires a focus on guiding others and taking on projects that impact the entire organization.

Think about the following engineers. The first engineer who regularly completes work by working after hours, produces a lot of code, and meets deadlines. In contrast, the second one assumes responsibility for cross-functional projects, focuses on identifying trends, solving issues that affect numerous teams, and shares knowledge to elevate team productivity. Although both engineers are valuable, the second engineer has a much higher chance of being given a promotion. Why? Since he is not only making a positive contribution to the team but also driving its success and exhibiting crucial leadership traits at the senior level. 


## The Path to Promotion: Focus on Next-Level Problems and Leadership
To get past mid-senior you need to stop focusing on the work you do and focus on the impact of that work. Will Larson, in his book An Elegant Puzzle, discusses how senior engineers should focus on high-leverage activities, such as system design and mentorship, rather than getting caught up in day-to-day coding tasks. Below are three step strategy that can help you grow.

### 1. Work on Next-Level Scoped Problems
At the mid-senior level, technical skills are expected. What distinguishes you is your ability to work on problems of a larger scope and greater strategic importance. These are problems that require not only technical expertise but also business acumen and the ability to connect your solutions to the company's long-term goals.

Here is an example of owning a cross-team initiative. Suppose there are problems integrating a certain new technology stack across different products. Instead of contributing to this initiative by writing code for only your application, one could take ownership of the entire project. This would be carried out by coordinating with the involved teams, understanding the variations in need and constraint, and thereafter delivering a solution keeping in view the overall strategy of the product platform. This means you're solving more than a problem; you can show that you can manage complexity, influence others, and drive outcomes which have a material impact on the business.


### 2. Deliver Through Others
As you go up the career ladder, success for you will be delivered through influencing and guiding people around you. This perhaps will be one of the most important transitions from an individual contributor to a leader. Whether you mentor, delegate, and collaborate across teams is going to be most crucial for your promotion.

Suppose you are tasked with the implementation of some new feature. Instead of making the whole implementation yourself, you realize that there's a junior who can take on some portions of the implementation. You then invest in teaching them through proper specification and best practices needed. By effectively delegating, you empower others, freeing your time for more strategic activities at higher levels. This way, you show that you can lead a team, which is one of the competencies needed to access senior positions. 

### 3. Think strategically and be proactive.
The level at which you work requires good execution; you must think strategically. That means knowing the context of the business, knowing what problems are going to happen in the future, and therefore proactively suggesting solutions.
Suppose you find your company's development process haemorrhaging inefficiencies, slowing down the release cycle. Maybe instead of waiting for another person to fix that problem, you could propose a new initiative which smooths out the process. You would research best practices, build stakeholder support, and lead the implementation of the new process. This proves that apart from you being a problem solver, you are also a strategic thinker who can seize opportunities and ensure change.


## Final Words! Shift Your Mindset, Elevate Your Career
If you feel stuck at your current level, it’s time to rethink your approach. Growing is not just about working harder—they’re about demonstrating your ability to handle next-level challenges and lead others to success. Jeff Shannon, author of Hard Work is Not Enough: The Surprising Truth about Being Believable at Work, wrote people will tell you that hard work will take you far, but it won't. He believes that "hard work is a good start" to get yourself established early in your job, but it is not enough to help you rise to the top.

Start by focusing on problems that have a broader impact, mentor and guide your peers, and think strategically about how you can contribute to the company’s long-term goals. By making these shifts, you’ll not only position yourself for progression but also develop the skills and mindset needed to thrive in senior-level roles. It isn’t just about the hours you put in—it’s about the difference you make.
