## Introduction
Imagine a bustling shopping centre in a metropolis with dozens of independent boutiques, each located in different corners. You’re on a mission to find a specific outfit, and to do so, you must navigate through the complex maze of stores. This is much like a cloud-native architecture - a complex system of small, independent services that need to locate and interact with each other. Navigating this system can be as challenging as finding that perfect outfit, but with the right tools, it is manageable.

One practical solution is to utilize Registry/Discovery and Definitions services. Imagine service discovery as an interactive mall directory, guiding shoppers directly to the store they need. Service definitions, on the other hand, function as a detailed store catalogue, outlining each service offering. In this article, we’ll explore these crucial components, their role in synchronous and asynchronous communication, and how they contribute to efficient, reliable, and scalable cloud-native applications. 

As I have mentioned in a [previous article](https://www.gaurgaurav.com/cloud_native/decoding-synchronous-and-asynchronous-communication-in-cloud-native-applications/){:target="_blank"}, there are two types of communication in cloud-native architecture. Let’s first focus our discussion on how synchronous communication can use service registry and service definitions to improve the architecture.
