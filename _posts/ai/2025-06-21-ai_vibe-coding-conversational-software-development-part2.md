## Inroduction
In my previous blog post, I introduced the concept of __Vibe Coding__. It is one of the new ways that is attracting even non-programmers. Users can describe their thoughts using natural language and AI tools would convert that into a working application. Spotting this opportunity, I thought I should experiment and understand what that actually looks like in action. I took this opportunity to test out a few tools and see how they really impact my workflow.

)*Vibe coding is a declarative approach*

It is not just about automating tasks; it is about changing our behaviour on how to approach a problem. To me, it feels like a declarative approach, especially when you are navigating a new framework or language for the first time. 

## Smarter Coding in the IDE: GitHub Copilot

I first started with the most common tool that is gaining popularity in the corporate world. It is [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot){:target="_blank"}. I have been using it regularly in VS Code, and while it is not exactly magic, it is undoubtedly helpful. When I am deep into the code and I use it for quick assistance with things like scaffolding code, writing tests, or debugging tricky edge cases. It saves me time context switching to browser. You can interact with Copilot right in your code or you can open a chat window to explain your issue.

Copilot now has an “*agent mode*,” which allows you to give broader instructions that can span across multiple files at feature level. It is not flawless and can sometimes come up with generic solutions. But most of the time it helps to cut down time spent on the boilerplate code.

The best part of copilot is that it is embedded in the editor, which means it is just a click away whenever I need it. Also, it is context-aware, it often makes suggestions that fits with existing application style and architecture.

## Terminal-First Development: Claude Code
There are developers who love working in the terminal. I would suggest tools like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/home){:target="_blank"} or [OpenCodeX CLI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11096431-openai-codex-cli-getting-started){:target="_blank"} for them. These are worth checking out. Although it works from the terminal, but it understands your entire codebase and can implement changes based on natural language commands.

I recently tried out Claude Code for a side project. From the CLI, I was able to set up a basic project, refactor functions, and even tidy up some old scripts. It is not a traditional simple text-based interface, and I recommend it as a must have in your toolkit.

Anthropic has done a good job with [Claude Code documenration and working examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart){:target="_blank"}. It is worth checking out if you are curious.
