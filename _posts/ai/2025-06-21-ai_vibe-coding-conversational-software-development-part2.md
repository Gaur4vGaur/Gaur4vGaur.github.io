## Inroduction
In my previous blog post, I introduced the concept of __Vibe Coding__. It is one of the new ways that is attracting even non-programmers. Users can describe their thoughts using natural language and AI tools would convert that into a working application. Spotting this opportunity, I thought I should experiment and understand what that actually looks like in action. I took this opportunity to test out a few tools and see how they really impact my workflow.

)*Vibe coding is a declarative approach*

It is not just about automating tasks; it is about changing our behaviour on how to approach a problem. To me, it feels like a declarative approach, especially when you are navigating a new framework or language for the first time.
