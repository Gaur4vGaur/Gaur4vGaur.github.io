## Inroduction

Welcome to the fourth and final post in my __Vibe Code__ series. In the [previous article](https://www.gaurgaurav.com/2025/ai/vibe-coding-conversational-software-development-part3/){:target="_blank"}, I explained how *system prompts* can steer AI behaviour by setting initial expectations and boundaries. But if you have worked on even any mildly complex application, you will know that first draft is never the final version. You always have some sort of UX tweaks, performance enhancements, or new feature requirements.

That is where __task-level prompting__ comes into the play. Once your foundation is in place, the next step is to provide instructions to AI to build, improve, and polish step by step. In this blog post, I will share several approaches that have worked well for me.
