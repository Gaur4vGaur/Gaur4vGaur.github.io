## Inroduction
Clearly, artificial intelligence(AI) is having a moment. I recently found out that AI and machine learning is not a new concept and first appeared in 1950s. Researchers at the time aimed to create machines that could think independently. But they struggled with language understanding and common-sense reasoning. Over time, as more data became available, scientists developed statistical models that allowed machines to learn rules by themselves, significantly advancing the field[^footnote].

And now AI seems to be appearing everywhere, and its applications are only getting more powerful. That got me thinking—it’s time for me to learn more about these concepts. I do not just want to understand AI better; I also want to reiterate and share what I have learned. The more I know, the better prepared I am for my next role.

But as soon as I started reading about AI, I came across many new terminologies. Some clicked right away, and others left me scratching my head. So, my first goal is to wrap my head around these everyday AI basics.

## Machine Learning
When I was in high school, I was fond of chess and wanted to get better at it. So, my father bought me a gaming console with Battle Chess[^fn-nth-2]. I played that game over and over again for a week, and each time it beat me. I started to wonder if the thing in the box was smarter than me. As it turns out, the console was not necessarily smarter than me; it was just a whole lot faster. A smart developer had coded IF-ELSE Boolean statements. All these statements were pre-programmed. Whenever I made a move, the machine would speed through its logic to calculate its next best position. The logic was good enough to beat me but was just rule-based[^fn-nth-3]. The developers would need a chess master to write their logic.

Decades later, Google developed a computer program AlphaZero[^fn-nth-4]. The program can learn games without being taught by humans. The algorithm can do much more than just playing chess. It has mastered Shogi and Go, games so complex that they cannot be programmed using simple IF-ELSE logic. AlphaZero uses a method of deep learning called artificial neural networks, which is a form of machine learning.
Machine learning is now not only restricted to these games; we are experience it every day, even if we do not realize it. Websites like Amazon suggest new products you might want to purchase, or Netflix recommends movies you might like-that is machine learning in play. Unlike traditional programming, where developers must tell a machine exactly what to do, these advanced algorithms can learn by analysing data. The more data we provide them, the better they are at making predictions and decisions.

Newer machine learning systems are far more superior than simple logic statements. These deep learning systems are inspired from human brains, which consists of interconnected neurons. As a general-purpose technology, machine learning can potentially be used in various fields, from politics to DNA sequencing
