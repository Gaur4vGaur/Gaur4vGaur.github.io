Sometimes, we work in teams where code churn is high. Multiple developers working on features in the same code base, and there is a pressure of delivery. In these high-pressure situations reviewing code becomes critical. However, the pressure of delivery pushes the team to merge the code as soon as possible.

A well thought through CI pipeline can make a developer's life easier. Teams can quickly hook the CI pipeline updates to slack channels. These updates can include:
* A merge request that was raised
* Any failed test scenarios on the merge request
* CI to run code coverage tools and report it back to the team
* CI to run static analysis job to provide immediate feedback to developers

Thus, when a peer reviews the code, it has already passed a few quality gates.
